# Prospect Theory Applications

A practical guide to applying prospect theory in business strategy, personal finance, marketing, negotiation, and everyday decision-making. Prospect theory, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, is the most influential descriptive theory of decision-making under uncertainty and has transformed our understanding of how people actually make choices.

## What is Prospect Theory?

Prospect theory describes how people evaluate potential gains and losses when making decisions under uncertainty. Unlike expected utility theory, which assumes people are perfectly rational, prospect theory accounts for the systematic ways in which real human behavior deviates from rationality.

The theory has four key components that together explain a wide range of observed decision behaviors: reference dependence, loss aversion, diminishing sensitivity, and probability weighting. Each of these components has practical applications that can improve decision-making in business and personal contexts.

## The Four Pillars of Prospect Theory

### Reference Dependence
People evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point rather than in absolute terms. A salary of $80,000 feels like a gain if you expected $70,000 but like a loss if you expected $90,000, even though the objective amount is identical. The reference point is typically the status quo, an expectation, or a social comparison.

**Business Application**: When presenting changes to customers, employees, or partners, carefully consider what their reference point is. A price increase framed as a reduction from a higher list price feels different from the same increase framed as a departure from last year's price. Understanding reference points allows you to communicate changes more effectively.

### Loss Aversion
Losses loom larger than equivalent gains. The pain of losing $100 is psychologically about twice as intense as the pleasure of gaining $100. This asymmetry drives many seemingly irrational behaviors, from the reluctance to sell losing investments to the power of money-back guarantees.

**Business Application**: Structure offers to minimize perceived losses rather than maximize perceived gains. Free trials leverage loss aversion because canceling feels like losing something you already have. Loyalty programs that show points at risk of expiring motivate more action than programs that only emphasize points to be gained.

### Diminishing Sensitivity
The subjective difference between $100 and $200 feels larger than the difference between $1,100 and $1,200, even though both gaps are objectively $100. This diminishing sensitivity applies to both gains and losses and explains why people become less sensitive to additional gains or losses as amounts increase.

**Business Application**: When communicating value, separate gains and combine losses. Announcing three small improvements to a product over time creates more total positive impact than announcing all three simultaneously. Conversely, delivering bad news all at once is less painful than spreading it out over multiple announcements.

### Probability Weighting
People systematically distort probabilities when making decisions. They overweight small probabilities, which explains the appeal of both lotteries and insurance, and underweight moderate to high probabilities. A 1% chance of a large gain is psychologically weighted as more than 1%, making long-shot bets attractive.

**Business Application**: Product warranties and satisfaction guarantees are disproportionately valued by consumers because they address low-probability but emotionally salient negative outcomes. Similarly, premium pricing can be justified by offering protection against unlikely but feared events.

## Practical Applications

### Pricing Strategy
Prospect theory offers several actionable insights for pricing. Unbundle gains by listing individual features rather than a single package price. Bundle losses by presenting a single total price rather than itemizing costs. Use reference prices to make your price seem like a gain. Frame discounts in percentage terms for low-price items and dollar terms for high-price items.

### Employee Compensation
Pay raises feel like gains relative to the current salary reference point. Frequent small raises create more sustained satisfaction than infrequent large raises due to diminishing sensitivity. Bonuses should be delivered separately from salary to be perceived as distinct gains. Performance feedback should be consolidated when negative and distributed when positive.

### Negotiation Strategy
In negotiations, the first offer sets a powerful reference point. Concessions feel like losses to the party making them, so they should be small, incremental, and reciprocated. Packaging multiple issues together allows both parties to achieve gains on their priority issues while accepting losses on less important ones, with gains perceived as larger than equivalent losses due to diminishing sensitivity.

### Product Design and Marketing
Products should be designed to avoid features that trigger loss aversion. Subscription services that remove features at lower tiers feel like losses, so structuring tiers as adding features to a base level is psychologically superior. Marketing messages should emphasize losses avoided rather than gains achieved when promoting risk-reduction products.

### Personal Decision-Making
Understanding prospect theory can dramatically improve your personal decisions. Recognize when loss aversion is keeping you in a suboptimal situation. Notice when your reference point is distorting your evaluation of objectively good outcomes. Be aware when probability weighting is making you overvalue unlikely scenarios.

Building personal decision rules that account for these predictable biases is one of the most effective ways to improve your decisions. [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) provides the tools and frameworks to create these rules, track your decisions, and refine your approach based on outcomes.

## Integration with Other Behavioral Concepts

Prospect theory does not operate in isolation. It interacts with mental accounting, framing effects, the endowment effect, and status quo bias. Understanding these interactions provides a richer toolkit for predicting and influencing decisions. This repository includes examples of how multiple behavioral concepts combine in real-world scenarios.
